## Android Features

- `feature/devices`: home device flow, browsing, variants, OTA details
- `feature/downloads`: download queue and file lifecycle
- `feature/otatools`: Manual Query, Partition Extraction, Link Resolver
- `feature/browser`: in-app WebView browser
- `feature/settings`: theme, browser preferences, etc.
- `feature/about`: project information

## Setup

1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Create `keystore.properties` in the project root if you want signed release builds.
3. Add:

```properties
STORE_PASSWORD=your_store_password
KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
```

4. Sync Gradle.
5. Run the `app` configuration on an Android 10+ device or emulator.

## Notes for Contributors

- keep device definitions and provider mappings in `catalog`
- keep user-facing flows in `feature`
- keep OTA parsing / extraction logic in `ota` and `arb`
- move code into `core` only when it is genuinely shared
- treat the root landing page as a separate web asset, not part of the Android runtime
